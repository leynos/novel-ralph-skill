"""Shared ``driver`` fixture for the ``novel`` multiplexer dispatch suites.

This module is a pytest plugin registered through ``pytest_plugins`` in
``tests/conftest.py``, beside ``corpus_fixtures`` and its siblings. It is the
single home for the in-process drive fixture the unit suite
(``tests/test_multiplexer_dispatch.py``) and the behavioural suite
(``tests/test_multiplexer_behaviour.py``) share, so neither module re-spells the
driver mechanics. The fixture is consumed **by name** — never by a runtime value
import — exactly as the developers-guide "Shared test scaffolding" rule requires;
the :class:`Driver` *type* may be imported under ``TYPE_CHECKING`` to annotate
the fixture's value, the one sanctioned exception. Splitting the two suites keeps
each within the 400-line module cap (AGENTS.md lines 24-27); registering this as
a plugin keeps ``driver`` available by name exactly as a ``conftest`` fixture
would be.

    Bundling ``capsys`` into one fixture keeps each behavioural test's parameter
    list within the project's argument-count gate (Pylint ``too-many-arguments``)
    while still delivering the capture mechanics by fixture name, exactly as
    ``tests/test_command_surface_matrix.py`` does. The two arms are closures over
    the test's ``capsys`` rather than methods, so they carry no unused ``self``.
    This type may be imported under ``TYPE_CHECKING`` by the consuming suites (the
    developers-guide shared-type carve-out); the fixture is consumed by name.

    Attributes
    ----------
    mux : _MuxDrive
        Drives the multiplexer over an argv, resolving the command name through
        ``novel``'s own ``_command_name_for``.
    direct : _DirectDrive
        Drives a single leaf ``build_app`` over an argv under the given name —
        the same ``build_app`` the multiplexer mounts, the parity oracle the
        no-behaviour-change proof compares against (Decision Log D1).

    The multiplexer arm resolves its command name through ``novel``'s own
    :func:`~novel_ralph_skill.commands.novel._command_name_for`, so the test
    exercises the entry point's name derivation rather than re-spelling it. Both
    arms drive through the shared ``run`` wrapper, which always exits, so the
    :class:`SystemExit` code is the contract exit code and ``capsys`` captures the
    rendered envelope (if any).

    Parameters
    ----------
    capsys : pytest.CaptureFixture[str]
        Captures the rendered stdout.

        A driver bundling the ``mux`` and ``direct`` drive arms.
