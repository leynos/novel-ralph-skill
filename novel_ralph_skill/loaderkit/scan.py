r"""The shared per-line scan primitive both pack detectors consume (design §6.1).

Roadmap task 7.2.2 consolidates the byte-identical ``_scan_rule``/``_scan_device``
bodies here, and roadmap 7.2.3 relocates their neutral input and output shapes —
:class:`ScannedChapter` and :class:`LineHit` — alongside them, so the per-line
scan's single home is complete. :func:`scan_pattern` splits each chapter into
physical lines and runs a precompiled pattern's :meth:`re.Pattern.finditer` per
line, accumulating one hit per match. The no-flags compilation the loaders use
means ``.`` cannot cross ``\n``, so a per-line scan makes line numbers exact and
bounds every match to one line (the v1 single-line-coverage discipline; ADR-001).

The primitive carries no ``Rule``/``Device`` knowledge: the caller dereferences
``rule.compiled``/``device.compiled`` before calling, and supplies a ``line_hit``
constructor so this module never imports a pack-domain hit type. Both scan shapes
are plain frozen dataclasses with only stdlib-typed fields, so this module imports
neither ``rulepack`` nor ``ledger`` at runtime *or* under
:data:`typing.TYPE_CHECKING`; the direction ``rulepack.detect → loaderkit.scan`` /
``ledger.detect → loaderkit.scan`` stays acyclic.

    r"""Count one pattern's non-overlapping matches per physical line.

    Splits each chapter into physical lines and runs ``pattern`` over each line
    independently, recording the one-based line index directly (the enumeration
    index, no offset arithmetic). This is the line-by-line scan the loaders'
    no-flags compilation requires: ``.`` cannot cross ``\n``, so a per-line scan
    makes line numbers exact and bounds every match to one line.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pattern : re.Pattern[str]
        The precompiled pattern to scan (the caller dereferences
        ``rule.compiled``/``device.compiled`` first, so this primitive holds no
        ``Rule``/``Device`` knowledge).
    chapters : collections.abc.Sequence[ScannedChapter]
        The scanned chapters, in order.
    line_hit : collections.abc.Callable[[int, int], LineHit]
        Constructs a :class:`LineHit` from ``(chapter_number, line_index)``; the
        caller passes ``lambda chapter, line: LineHit(chapter=chapter, line=line)``
        so this module never imports a pack-domain hit type at runtime.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[int, tuple[LineHit, ...]]
        The total non-overlapping match count and the per-match ``LineHit`` tuple,
        in scan order (ascending chapter, then line, then left-to-right).
